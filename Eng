Alteryx cannot display pop-ups, but it can execute batch jobs 
and send emails.
So it is sufficient if we receive an email
indicating whether the job has been completed.

We plan to run the batch at 11:00 and 11:50.
When the 11:00 batch runs,
if there is an issue with the files (for example, 
a missing pair or mismatched content), 
the email should indicate what the problem is.

The process compares files in two folders using Python and Alteryx,
checking whether the corresponding (paired) files exist and 
whether their contents match.
