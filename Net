November 11 was a US holiday, and the cash flows were –53,108 on the 11th 
and 56,102 on the 12th. 
These should have been netted, but we mistakenly settled them on a gross basis.
As a result, we already sent 53,108, 
so the correct settlement would have been for you to send 56,102.

However, your statement reflects only the net amount, 
so could you please return the 53,108 to us?
Apologies for the inconvenience.

To avoid any confusion going forward, 
we will make sure not to settle on US holidays.

Thank you for your understanding
